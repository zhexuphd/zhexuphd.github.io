My name is Zhe Xu, and I am a Walter Benjamin fellow and postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Media and Communication](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Thomas Hanitzsch](https://www.ifkw.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/personen/professoren/hanitzsch_thomas/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Neil Thurman](https://neilthurman.com/). 

I currently work in **humanitarianism** and **crisis communication** through **computational modeling** and **social computing**, studying how information and technology engage with **humanitarian crises** and how public decision-making is shaped as a result. Two current directions:
- using natural language processing to classify humanitarian news corpora through the lens of communication ethics;
- studying responsible AI and virtual reality embodiment in the mediation of humanitarian crisis.

I have been a Visiting Scholar at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). I hold degrees in engineering science and media studies, and earned my Ph.D. in 2023 from the [University of Cologne](https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/). While there, I served as a research and teaching assistant in media studies and received training in data science and machine learning from the [Center for Data and Simulation Science (CDS)](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/) and the [Department of Digital Humanities (IDH)](https://dh.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/).
